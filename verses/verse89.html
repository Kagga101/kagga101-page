  <h1>Kagga 101 – Verse #89</h1>

  <p>This verse meditates upon the eternal presence of the Self, revealed through the fleeting but luminous opening of the present moment. In harmony with the teachings of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gītā, it affirms that the now is not merely a temporal slice, but the gateway through which one perceives the unchanging amidst change—the Self (Ātman), identical with Brahman, the Absolute Reality.</p>

  <p><strong>“Without a trace of life in the past nor a hint of breath ahead,”</strong><br>
  This line strips away the illusions of past and future, revealing that neither holds reality in themselves. As the Kaṭha Upanishad teaches, the Self is beyond time: <em>na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin</em>—it is never born nor does it die. The Gītā (2.16) affirms: <em>nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ</em>—the Real never ceases to be. The past is memory, the future is projection—both products of <em>manas</em> (mind), veiling the pure Presence of the Self. The breath that animates the body arises only in the now; thus, life is found only in Presence, not in what has passed or is yet to come.</p>

  <p><strong>“Eternity fills the sliver of the instant that’s in between wedged.”</strong><br>
  Here, the verse proclaims a profound Vedantic truth: the Eternal is not elsewhere—it shines fully in the now. The Muṇḍaka Upanishad says: <em>yasmin idaṁ sarvaṁ otam</em>—in That all is woven. Though the present seems but a fleeting sliver between past and future, it is in truth the only contact point with <em>sat</em> (pure being). The Gītā speaks of the Yogi, whose mind is steady in the Self, finding <em>brahmānanda</em>, the bliss of Brahman, in every moment. Thus, this “sliver of the instant” is the field of realization, where the finite meets the Infinite.</p>

  <p><strong>“In this split moment, mind and body melt and sight and the seen unite”</strong><br>
  This line speaks to the non-dual realization (<em>advaita</em>) that arises when ego (<em>ahaṅkāra</em>) dissolves. When mind and body, usually perceived as separate, “melt,” what remains is the undivided witness (<em>sākṣī</em>), the seer who is neither the seen nor the act of seeing, but that by which all seeing occurs. The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishad (4.3.23) declares: <em>neti neti</em>—"not this, not this"—instructing us to go beyond all dualities and identifications. In such a moment, sight and the seen unite because the distinction between subject and object collapses, revealing Brahman as all—<em>sarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma</em> (Chāndogya Upanishad 3.14.1).</p>

  <p><strong>“Giving a glimpse of the world of beauty, an everlasting delight!”</strong><br>
  This concluding line celebrates the <em>ānanda</em> (bliss) that arises when one glimpses Reality through the stillness of full presence. The Gītā (6.21–22) describes this as: <em>yam labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ</em>—having attained it, one considers no other gain greater. The “world of beauty” revealed here is not the beauty of form, but the beauty of Truth—the unborn, undying, and unmoving Reality that alone brings enduring delight. It is not created by the mind, but uncovered when Māyā is pierced, even momentarily.</p>

  <h2>Philosophical and Spiritual Context:</h2>
  <p>This verse embodies the central teachings of Advaita Vedānta and the Bhagavad Gītā, wherein liberation (<em>mokṣa</em>) is attained not in some distant state but through inner stillness, in the ever-present Now. Time, in Vedanta, is a projection of the mind under Māyā; only Brahman is <em>nitya</em> (eternal) and <em>nirvikāra</em> (unchanging). The “split moment” reveals that eternity is not linear—it is the very ground of Being, unfolding moment to moment for the one who abides in the Self.</p>

  <p>In the Bhagavad Gītā (5.24), Krishna describes the <em>jnānī</em>, the one who realizes the Self, as already dwelling in Brahman, experiencing inner joy, inner light, and inner vision. This verse reflects such a state, where mind, body, and perception merge in the clarity of pure consciousness.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>This verse is a poetic unveiling of the Vedantic experience of non-dual awareness, where the limitations of time and individuality dissolve, revealing the everlasting delight of the Self. The “sliver of the instant” is not to be passed over; it is the gateway to Brahman, where dualities vanish, and only Truth remains. In such moments, the seeker glimpses that the Atman is Brahman, and this glimpse alone transforms life, anchoring it in stillness, unity, and joy beyond measure.</p>

  <h1>Kagga 101 – Verse #84</h1>

  <p>This verse explores the profound and multifaceted concept of Māyā, which is central to Hindu philosophy, particularly in the Advaita Vedanta tradition. It reflects on the interplay between the illusory world and the ultimate reality, touching upon themes of illusion, transcendence, and the nature of existence. Let’s break down the verse:</p>

  <p>"Māyā, her grandeur limitless, lures me with her appearance,"</p>

  <p>The verse begins by personifying Māyā as a grand, alluring force. Māyā, in Hindu philosophy, refers to the illusion or appearance of the material world, which masks the true, unchanging reality of the universe. Māyā is often described as something that entices, captivates, and misleads individuals into perceiving the world as separate and independent, when in truth it is an illusion.</p>

  <p>The idea that Māyā’s grandeur is limitless speaks to the vastness of this illusion. In a world where appearances seem so real and concrete, it’s easy for individuals to become attached to the temporary, the material, and the perceptible, as though these things were permanent and substantial. The illusion of duality created by Māyā leads us to believe in the separateness of things and our attachment to the physical world. This is often described in the Bhagavad Gita as the "deluding power" that prevents one from realizing the ultimate truth.</p>

  <p>"But then what of that which transcends all attributes, her true essence?"</p>

  <p>Here, the poet shifts attention from Māyā’s external allure to the true essence that transcends all attributes—this is a reference to the absolute reality, the Brahman, in Advaita Vedanta. Brahman is considered the ultimate, formless reality that is beyond all descriptions, names, and attributes.</p>

  <p>Māyā, while enchanting and real in its manifestation, is nothing more than a projection of Brahman, the ultimate truth. The verse points to the transcendence of Brahman, which exists beyond all distinctions and characteristics. Brahman, in its purest form, is beyond the dualities of subject and object, existence and non-existence, and cannot be fully grasped by the mind or senses. The question asked here points to the realization that the illusion of the world (Māyā) is only a temporary appearance, and the true essence is Brahman, which transcends all perceptible reality.</p>

  <p>"If she ceases, so do this world and the narrative of life."</p>

  <p>This line suggests that Māyā, as the illusionary force, is the basis of the apparent world and the narrative of life that we experience. If Māyā were to cease, so would the illusion of the world and the story of existence that we tell ourselves.</p>

  <p>In Advaita Vedanta, it is said that the world we perceive with our senses is a projection of the ultimate reality (Brahman), mediated by the power of Māyā. If the veil of Māyā were lifted, we would see that the distinctions we make between ourselves and the world around us—between life and death, subject and object—are ultimately illusory. The universe, in its apparent diversity, would collapse back into the oneness of Brahman. Life’s narrative, with its stories of birth, growth, suffering, and death, is thus ultimately a story shaped by illusion—a drama in which we are players, unaware of the underlying reality.</p>

  <p>"She's the mother, the projection of Brahman, and I her child!"</p>

  <p>The final line emphasizes the relationship between Māyā and Brahman. Māyā is described as the mother, who gives birth to and sustains the apparent world of forms and phenomena, while Brahman is the source, the underlying and unmanifest reality.</p>

  <p>In this metaphor, Māyā, as the mother, nurtures and sustains the illusionary world, and all individual beings (including the poet) are her children. The reference to being the child of Māyā signifies the individual soul’s (Atman) entanglement in the world of duality and illusion. The Atman (the individual soul) is ultimately the same as Brahman, but due to the influence of Māyā, it perceives itself as distinct from the ultimate reality. The child is subject to the mother's influence and yet is fundamentally one with the source from which it originates.</p>

  <p>This view aligns with the Advaita Vedanta perspective that Atman and Brahman are identical, but the perception of separation is caused by the veil of Māyā. The individual self, caught in this illusion, must strive to recognize its true nature as Brahman—to transcend the limitations imposed by Māyā and see the unity of all existence.</p>

  <h2>Philosophical and Spiritual Context:</h2>

  <p><strong>Advaita Vedanta:</strong> The verse strongly reflects the core tenets of Advaita Vedanta, a school of Hindu philosophy famously expounded by Adi Shankaracharya. According to Advaita Vedanta, the ultimate reality is Brahman, which is beyond all names and forms. The world we experience is a projection of Māyā, the illusion that causes us to perceive the multiplicity and diversity of existence. The goal of life, in this tradition, is to realize the non-dual nature of Atman (the self) and Brahman, transcending the illusion of Māyā through meditation, self-inquiry, and the realization of the unity of all existence.</p>

  <p><strong>Māyā:</strong> The concept of Māyā is central in many schools of Hindu thought, and it is often described as the veil of illusion that prevents the individual from seeing the true, unchanging reality of Brahman. Māyā is both the creative and deceptive power that manifests the world of duality, yet it is not separate from Brahman. It is sometimes described as a divine play or dance (the Līlā of Brahman), where the seemingly real world is an illusion that serves a greater purpose in the spiritual journey.</p>

  <p><strong>Bhagavad Gita:</strong> In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna that while the material world may appear real, it is ultimately a manifestation of divine Māyā, and that the true self (Atman) is eternal and beyond the illusion. The Gita teaches that through wisdom and detachment, one can transcend the effects of Māyā and attain liberation (moksha) by recognizing the ultimate unity of all things.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

  <p>This verse poignantly illustrates the relationship between Māyā (the illusory world) and Brahman (the ultimate reality). It speaks to the idea that while Māyā entices and lures us into the illusion of duality, its true essence is a projection of Brahman, the formless, timeless reality. Life and existence, as we perceive them, are ultimately a manifestation of Māyā’s grandeur, but they are not the ultimate truth. The verse invites us to look beyond the illusion and to recognize that, as individuals, we are not separate from the infinite, unchanging reality of Brahman. We are all part of a greater, interconnected whole, and the journey toward self-realization involves recognizing that we are, in essence, not the children of Māyā, but of the divine itself.</p>

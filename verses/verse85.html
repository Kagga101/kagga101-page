  <h1>Kagga 101 – Verse #85</h1>

  <p>This verse presents a profound philosophical reflection on the forces that shape human life—desire, compassion, and peace—and how they influence our journey toward Self-realization. The verse unfolds as an inner dialogue, gradually guiding the reader from the compulsions of ego and longing to the quiet, liberating wisdom of the eternal Self (Ātman). Through this progression, it echoes the essential teachings of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, which show that the highest peace comes not from external striving but from the dissolution of duality and union with Brahman, the ultimate reality.</p>

  <p><strong>“Seize, rule, enjoy and control," desire cajoles.</strong><br>
  The verse begins with the voice of kāma (desire), a powerful force described in the Bhagavad Gita as the cause of delusion and suffering. Desire entices us toward the world of sense-objects, pushing us to possess, dominate, and enjoy. Krishna teaches:<br>
  “It is desire and anger, born of rajas, all-consuming and greatly sinful—know this to be the enemy here.”(Gita 3.37)</p>

  <p>Desire operates through the senses and the mind, binding us to samsāra—the cycle of birth and death—by keeping us identified with the body-mind complex and distracted from our eternal nature. This line captures how the voice of desire seduces the seeker away from inner contentment and toward the false promises of external power and pleasure.</p>

  <p><strong>"Give, share, help and support," compassion implores.</strong><br>
  Contrasting the pull of desire is the voice of compassion, which invites selflessness, generosity, and care for others. In the Gita, such conduct arises from sattva, the guṇa of clarity, harmony, and truth. A sattvic person acts out of dharma, not for reward, but as an offering to the divine:<br>
  “He who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord, is unaffected by sinful action.” (Gita 5.10)</p>

  <p>This line reflects the shift from self-centered action to self-offering—a hallmark of karma yoga, the path of acting in alignment with dharma while relinquishing attachment to outcomes. Compassion, then, becomes a means of inner purification, softening the ego and aligning the heart with the truth of oneness.</p>

  <p><strong>But peace inspires as it notes that ‘you’ and ‘I’ are mere roles,</strong><br>
  Here, the verse moves beyond even compassion, invoking peace (śānti) as the fruit of Self-knowledge (jñāna). True peace is not merely the absence of conflict, but the realization that individual identities—“you” and “I”—are constructs born of ignorance (avidyā). The Upanishads teach that all distinctions arise from māyā, the illusory power that creates a world of multiplicity, while concealing the undivided nature of Brahman:<br>
  “He who sees all beings in the Self and the Self in all beings, never turns away from It.” (Isha Upanishad 6)</p>

  <p>This line reveals the non-dual essence (Advaita) at the heart of Vedantic wisdom: that the seeming division between self and other is a role—a temporary appearance—played out in the theatre of the world. Peace arises when one awakens to the awareness that these roles do not define the eternal Self.</p>

  <p><strong>So shed them and ascend the throne of the universal soul!</strong><br>
  The final line calls the seeker to transcend the illusion of individuality, discard the false masks of ego, and abide in the truth of Ātman, which is none other than Brahman. This is the very goal of Vedanta: to go beyond name and form (nāma-rūpa) and realize the Self as pure, infinite consciousness.<br>
  “Having known That, one goes beyond death; there is no other path to immortality.” (Śvetāśvatara Upanishad 3.8)</p>

  <p>The “throne of the universal soul” is a poetic image for mokṣa, the state of liberation in which one no longer identifies with the limited body-mind, but rests in the fullness of Being itself. This is not an ascent of ambition, but a return to one's true nature, which was never separate from the universal to begin with.</p>

  <h2>Philosophical and Spiritual Context:</h2>
  <p><strong>Kāma and Ahamkāra:</strong> Desire arises from the ego's identification with the body and mind. According to the Gita, when actions are motivated by desire, the mind becomes restless, veiled by rājas, and estranged from the Self.</p>
  <p><strong>Dharma and Sattva:</strong> Compassionate, dharmic action reflects the predominance of sattva, the quality of purity and light. Such action uplifts, purifies, and prepares the seeker for higher knowledge, as described in karma yoga.</p>
  <p><strong>Māyā and Role-Playing:</strong> The roles of “you” and “I” are the play of māyā, not the truth of the Self. The Upanishads emphasize that all dualities are superimpositions on the singular reality of Brahman.</p>
  <p><strong>Ātman is Brahman:</strong> The realization of non-duality is the highest teaching of Advaita Vedanta. The verse’s call to "shed" all roles and sit on the "throne" symbolizes the claiming of one's true identity as Brahman—infinite, indivisible, and free.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>This verse is a poetic journey from desire to dharma, and from ego to enlightenment. While desire whispers of power and possession, and compassion calls us to service, it is peace—born of wisdom—that reveals the illusion behind all roles.</p>
  <p>The highest truth of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita is this: we are not the doer, the enjoyer, the giver, or the seeker—we are the eternal witness, the Self, pure and unchanging. When we relinquish our mistaken identities and cease clinging to the roles we play, we realize that we have always been one with the universal soul.</p>
  <p>To “ascend the throne” is not to become more, but to remember who we are—Ātman, ever free, ever whole, ever one with Brahman.</p>

  <h1>Kagga 101 – Verse #97</h1>

  <p>This verse offers a profound meditation on the performative nature of worldly existence, echoing the Upanishadic and Bhagavad Gītā’s view that much of life is shaped by <em>māyā</em>—the great illusion that veils reality. In this cosmic theater (<em>līlā</em>), individuals act out roles fashioned by desire (<em>kāma</em>), ego (<em>ahaṅkāra</em>), and attachment to the material world. What appears as reality is, in truth, a layered performance, driven by the interplay of the <em>guṇas</em>—<em>sattva</em>, <em>rajas</em>, and <em>tamas</em>—which condition human behavior and perception.</p>

  <p><strong>“Portraits of men and women, the roles they play and their pretenses”</strong><br>
  This opening line conjures the image of <em>nāma-rūpa</em>—name and form—the twin constructs through which the <em>jīvātman</em> identifies with the ephemeral. Just as the Upanishads urge the seeker to move from the visible to the invisible, from the apparent to the Real, so too does this verse hint at the masks people wear as a barrier to recognizing the <em>ātmā</em>, the true Self. Each role—be it parent, professional, or companion—is a temporary cloak donned under the influence of <em>māyā</em>, concealing the immutable self which is <em>sat-cit-ānanda</em>—existence, consciousness, and bliss.</p>

  <p><strong>“Their masks, facades and costumes, and their many tongues and dialects”</strong><br>
  This line expands the idea of fragmentation—where the self is dispersed into multiple identities to fit external molds. According to the Bhagavad Gītā (2.20), the Self is <em>ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo</em>—unborn, eternal, and changeless. Yet, under the sway of <em>avidyā</em> (ignorance), the individual assumes masks and dialects to navigate a world of dualities. These shifting expressions are the outer coverings of the ego-bound self, functioning within a web of social expectations and conditioned tendencies (<em>saṁskāras</em>), all of which are impermanent.</p>

  <p><strong>“Bring wonder, glitz and glamour as they stream in and as they march out”</strong><br>
  The dazzling appeal of worldly roles aligns with what Krishna calls <em>moham</em>—delusion born of <em>rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em>. The Gītā (3.27) reminds us: <em>prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ</em>—all actions are performed by the modes of material nature, yet one deluded by ego thinks, “I am the doer.” The procession of roles and accolades is transient, like waves on the ocean—appearing, shining for a moment, and then dissolving. The glamor of worldly success is thus a fleeting manifestation of <em>māyā</em>, incapable of touching the <em>ātmā</em>, which remains untouched by fame or obscurity.</p>

  <p><strong>“It's a parade of charades, this engrossing world of ours!”</strong><br>
  Here, the verse culminates in a striking image of <em>saṁsāra</em>—the cyclical, ever-changing spectacle of existence. In the Chāndogya Upanishad, the metaphor of dream and waking life blurs to show the unreality of both; likewise, this "parade" is a captivating illusion. The Gītā’s call to rise above <em>moha</em> (delusion) and rediscover one’s essential being—the witness (<em>sākṣin</em>) beyond the stage—is echoed here. True freedom lies not in perfecting the performance, but in realizing the futility of performance itself. Only by recognizing the game (<em>līlā</em>) can one begin to transcend it.</p>

  <h2>Philosophical Implications:</h2>
  <p>The verse resonates deeply with Vedāntic metaphysics and Gītā’s ethic of <em>niṣkāma karma</em>—acting without attachment to outcome. It critiques the identification with roles as a source of bondage (<em>bandha</em>) and suffering. Just as the Upanishads teach the seeker to strip away the layers of self-identification—<em>neti, neti</em> ("not this, not this")—so too does this verse urge us to see beyond the masks we wear.</p>

  <p>Krishna advises Arjuna to act according to his <em>dharma</em>, but with inner renunciation—<em>tyāga</em>—and equanimity (<em>samatva</em>), not caught in the play of appearances. Thus, the verse is not nihilistic but invites discernment (<em>viveka</em>), urging us to distinguish the Real from the unreal, the Self from its shadow.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>This verse serves as a vivid illustration of the Upanishadic vision of <em>māyā</em>, and the Gītā’s call to spiritual clarity amidst illusion. The grand procession of identities, roles, and performances, though compelling, is ultimately ephemeral. Behind the spectacle stands the <em>ātmā</em>, untouched, pure, and free. The challenge is not merely to unmask the world, but to unmask ourselves—and in doing so, realize that the Self was never the actor, but the silent witness of the play all along.</p>

  <h1>Kagga 101 – Verse #91</h1>

  <p>This verse reverently affirms the enduring power of ancient wisdom—not as a relic of the past, but as a living stream that continues to nourish the present. Through imagery rooted in nature and philosophical inquiry, it echoes the teachings of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gītā, which emphasize that timeless truth (satyam), though ancient, remains eternally relevant, guiding each generation through the ever-shifting landscapes of life.</p>

  <p><strong>“You think it's become stale? And would you foolishly throw away / World’s sacred wisdom which age after age has lit the way?”</strong><br>
  This opening line challenges the modern tendency to dismiss the old as obsolete. But the Upanishads remind us that truth is never new, nor does it decay with time. As the Muṇḍaka Upanishad (1.2.13) declares: <em>tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet</em>—to realize that knowledge, one must approach a teacher who carries the living flame of tradition. The Bhagavad Gītā (4.2) says: <em>evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</em>—this wisdom was passed down through the lineage, known by the seers. To cast it aside is not progress, but forgetfulness of the very light that made progress possible.</p>

  <p><strong>“Isn’t it the broad base upon which stands knowledge of late?”</strong><br>
  All modern insight rests upon the foundational knowledge revealed in the <em>śruti</em>. The Taittirīya Upanishad begins with a vision of layered wisdom—<em>annamaya, prāṇamaya, manomaya, vijñānamaya,</em> and <em>ānandamaya</em>—revealing that new knowledge unfolds by ascending from the old. Without the base, the ascent is unstable. The Gītā does not reject reason or inquiry, but harmonizes them with ancient revelation, showing that true progress is a continuation, not a severance.</p>

  <p><strong>“It is the strength of old roots from which arise new shoots!”</strong><br>
  The metaphor of roots and shoots beautifully captures the Vedantic view of spiritual continuity. The roots are the eternal truths of the Vedas, hidden yet sustaining all growth. As the Kaṭha Upanishad (2.3.10) declares: <em>ūrdhva-mūlaṁ adhaḥ-śākham aśvattham</em>—the upside-down tree of existence has its roots in the eternal, and its branches in the world. To deny the roots is to dry up the tree. New expressions, new insights, and new forms of spiritual realization are shoots, nourished by the sap of ancient wisdom. Without this nourishment, they wither.</p>

  <h2>Philosophical and Spiritual Context:</h2>
  <p>In Vedānta, knowledge is not invented but revealed. The <em>ṛṣis</em> did not create truth—they saw it. The Vedas, as <em>apauruṣeya</em> (not of human origin), are eternal sound vibrations that reveal the nature of Brahman and the path to liberation. While the outer forms of culture may shift, the inner essence—that you are the Self (<em>tat tvam asi</em>)—remains unchanging.</p>

  <p>The Bhagavad Gītā itself is a synthesis of ancient wisdom, spoken by Krishna, the eternal Self, to Arjuna, the seeker confused by the tensions of the world. Krishna continually reorients Arjuna to <em>dharma</em>, not as a fixed rulebook but as a living principle, best understood by those rooted in the knowledge of the ancients.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>This verse is a call to reverent remembrance, not nostalgic regression. It affirms that the light which has guided generations—the <em>śāśvata dharma</em> (eternal way)—still shines, provided we are humble enough to look toward it. The roots of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gītā are deep, and from them, new shoots of realization, expression, and insight continuously emerge.</p>

  <p>To honor the old is not to be bound by it—it is to draw strength from that which endures, to recognize that truth transcends time, and that real progress is not possible unless it is nourished by what is timeless.</p>
